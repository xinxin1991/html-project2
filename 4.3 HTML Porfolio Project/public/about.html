<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I am Cici! I used to be a commercial real estate professional. Now I am
  taking self-study web development courses and trying to become a web
  developer.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently living in Suzhou China, a city with over 4,000 years of
  history. It is known as “Venice of the Orient” because of the rivers and
  canals all over the city.
</p>
<p>
  I have been to 15 out of 34 provincial-level administrative regions in China.
